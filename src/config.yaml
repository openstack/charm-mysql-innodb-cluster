  cluster-name:
    type: string
    description: Cluster name for the InnoDB cluster. Must be unique.
    default: jujuCluster
  auto-rejoin-tries:
    type: string
    default: "1000"
    description: |
      The number of tries instances make to rejoin the cluster after being
      expelled.
  expel-timeout:
    type: int
    default: 20
    description: |
      An integer value that specifies the period of time in seconds that cluster
      members should wait for a non-responding member before expelling it from the
      cluster. This value can be changed while Group Replication is running.
      Setting this value to N will mean that a member will be expelled after N + 5 seconds
      after the loss of connectivity.
      See the MySQL documentation related to the group_replication_member_expel_timeout option
      for more information.

  innodb-buffer-pool-size:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      By default this value will be set according to 50% of system total
      memory or 512MB (whichever is lowest) but also can be set to any specific
      value for the system. Supported suffixes include K/M/G/T. If suffixed
      with %, one will get that percentage of system total memory allocated.
  innodb-change-buffering:
    type: string
    default: "all"
    description: |
      Configure whether InnoDB performs change buffering, an optimization
      that delays write operations to secondary indexes so that the I/O
      operations can be performed sequentially.
      .
      Permitted values include
      .
        none        Do not buffer any operations.
        inserts     Buffer insert operations.
        deletes     Buffer delete marking operations; strictly speaking,
                    the writes that mark index records for later deletion
                    during a purge operation.
        changes     Buffer inserts and delete-marking operations.
        purges      Buffer the physical deletion operations that happen
                    in the background.
        all         The default. Buffer inserts, delete-marking
                    operations, and purges.

  innodb-io-capacity:
    type: int
    default: 200
    description: |
      Configure the InnoDB IO capacity which sets an upper limit on I/O
      activity performed by InnoDB background tasks, such as flushing pages
      from the buffer pool and merging data from the change buffer.
      .
      This value typically defaults to 200 but can be increased on systems
      with fast bus-attached SSD based storage to help the server handle the
      background maintenance work associated with a high rate of row changes.
      .
      Alternatively it can be decreased to a minimum of 100 on systems with
      low speed 5400 or 7200 rpm spindles, to reduce the proportion of IO
      operations being used for background maintenance work.
      .

  innodb-file-per-table:
    type: boolean
    default: True
    description: |
      Turns on innodb_file_per_table option, which will make MySQL put each
      InnoDB table into separate .idb file. Existing InnoDB tables will remain
      in ibdata1 file - full dump/import is needed to get rid of large
      ibdata1 file
  tuning-level:
    type: string
    default: safest
    description: |
      Valid values are 'safest', 'fast', and 'unsafe'. If set to 'safest', all
      settings are tuned to have maximum safety at the cost of performance.
      'fast' will turn off most controls, but may lose data on crashes.
      'unsafe' will turn off all protections but this may be OK in clustered
      deployments.
  table-open-cache:
    type: int
    default: 2048
    description:
      Sets table_open_cache (formerly known as table_cache) to mysql.
  max-connections:
    type: int
    default: 600
    description: |
      Maximum connections to allow. A value of -1 means use the server's
      compiled-in default. This is not typically that useful so the
      charm will configure PXC with a default max-connections value of 600.
      Note: Connections take up memory resources. Either at startup time with
      performance-schema=True or during run time with performance-schema=False.
      This value is a balance between connection exhaustion and memory
      exhaustion.
      .
      Consult a MySQL memory calculator like http://www.mysqlcalculator.com/ to
      understand memory resources consumed by connections.
      See also performance-schema.
  enable-binlogs:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      Turns on MySQL binary logs. The placement of the logs is controlled with
      the binlogs_path config option.
  binlogs-path:
    type: string
    default: /var/log/mysql/mysql-bin.log
    description: |
      Location on the filesystem where binlogs are going to be placed.
      Default mimics what mysql-common package would do for mysql.
      Make sure you do not put binlogs inside mysql datadir (/var/lib/mysql/)!
  binlogs-max-size:
    type: string
    default: 100M
    description: |
      Sets the max_binlog_size mysql configuration option, which will limit the
      size of the binary log files. The server will automatically rotate
      binlogs after they grow to be bigger than this value.
      Keep in mind that transactions are never split between binary logs, so
      therefore binary logs might get larger than configured value.
  binlogs-expire-days:
    type: int
    default: 10
    description: |
      Sets the expire_logs_days mysql configuration option, which will make
      mysql server automatically remove logs older than configured number of
      days.
  prefer-ipv6:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      If True enables IPv6 support. The charm will expect network interfaces
      to be configured with an IPv6 address. If set to False (default) IPv4
      is expected.
      .
      NOTE: these charms do not currently support IPv6 privacy extension. In
      order for this charm to function correctly, the privacy extension must be
      disabled and a non-temporary address must be configured/available on
      your network interface.
  wait-timeout:
    type: int
    default: 3600
    description: |
      The number of seconds the server waits for activity on a noninteractive
      connection before closing it.
      https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_wait_timeout
  os-db-router-hostname:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      The hostname or address of the db-router endpoint for mysql-innodb-cluster
